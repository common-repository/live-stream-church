This plugin automatically embeds live stream video and chat from YouTube into your website. Donations, beautiful design and easy configuration. It doesn't require YouTube API.

== Description ==

= What Is Live Stream Church? =

** DEMO: [https://delreyagency.com/live](https://delreyagency.com/live "Live Stream Church Demo") **

Live Stream Church allows you to auto-embed your YouTube live stream Church Service into your website. No more copy and paste embed codes!

The plugin will create a brand-new page into your website where your visitors will be able to watch the live stream. You will avoid sharing complicate YouTube links and instead people will watch the live service always using the same link (Example: church.com/live).

Another great advantage of Live Stream Church is the look and feel of the template. Your service will be shown in a clean and distraction free page inside your own website. You don't need to design nothing; we already did the hard work for you :)

A live stream without chat doesn't have too much sense. That's why Live Stream Church is also embedding the live chat from YouTube, so people will be able to comment the meeting directly from your website.

Take back the control of your online meetings and use the advantages of your own Church Website, the only online channel where you have the full control where you decide what to show.
